## If Christianity forbids divorce, then why are the divorce rates in Western countries so high?

A differentiation needs to be made between Westerners and Christians. Not all Westerners are Christians. Not all who call themselves Christians are true believers as well. Most of those who get divorced in the West are not true Christians.

Contrary to the Bible’s instructions on marriage, the divorce rate in Western countries is extremely high. This certainly is a problem. This unfortunately illustrates the teaching from the Bible that everyone sins and needs a Savior (Romans 3:22-24).

The Torah says that God made both man and woman in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). In marriage, the two become “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). Jesus quoted from these verses to emphasize that marriage is sacred. He only permitted divorce in cases of unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:3-12). Many Christians believe that the definition of the word “unfaithfulness” includes abandonment and abusiveness.

Christian marriage is so sacred that it is used throughout the New Testament to illustrate God’s love for His people (Ephesians 5:31-32). In the same way a man and a woman make a sacred, eternal and intimate covenant with one another, so too has God made His covenant with all who believe in Him.

## If God is love, why did the Crusaders slaughter innocent people in God’s name?

In the Middle Ages, some evil politicians used the name of God to justify their greed and desire for power. “Christian” Crusaders took Jerusalem on 15 July 1099 and viciously murdered all the Jews and Muslims. They committed sin in the name of Christianity.

Religious wars in the name of Christ do not reflect the spirit of the Injil. Jesus said, “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you” (Luke 6:27-28). The Injil teaches us to respond in love and not repay evil with evil.

The Injil also describes the true crusade that Christians should be involved in. “All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God” (2 Corinthians 5:18-20). Christians are to spread the Good News by loving others. The Crusaders did the very opposite of what Christians are to do.

Jesus, called the Prince of Peace, never commanded His followers to kill someone because they had a different religion.

## Which of Abraham’s sons did he sacrifice? Isaac or Ishmael?

There is only one place in the Qur’an that mentions Abraham’s sacrifice of his son (Surah As-Saffaat 37:99-106). However, this passage does not provide the name of the son that was to be sacrificed.

The Torah clearly provides the name of the son saying it was Isaac (Genesis 22:2). Isaac was the only boy in Abraham’s household at that time. Ishmael, who was 14 years old when Isaac was born, had already been sent away with his mother Hagar on the day Isaac was weaned (Genesis 21:8-10).

Isaac, not Ishmael, was the only promised child of Abraham (Genesis 17:15-21; Surahs Hud 11:69-73; As-Saffaat 37:112-113; Adh-Dhariyat 51:24-30). Isaac was conceived miraculously by a barren mother and an aged father (Genesis 17:15-17, 18:9-15, 21:1-7; Surahs Hud 11:69-73; Adh-Dhariyat 51:24-30). Ishmael was conceived normally.

The Qur’an gives no reason as to why God tested Abraham. But the Injil explains that Abraham and Isaac were an example of what would happen 2,000 years later on the same mountain where Isaac was to be sacrificed. In the same way that Abraham displayed unconditional love for God in his willingness to sacrifice his son, so too God gave up His only Son who hung on the cross to prove that He is the source of unconditional love.

God kept Abraham from completing the sacrifice. But God did not withhold His own hand from sacrificing His only Son so that we would be able to enter Paradise.

## Doesn’t Jesus’ words in John 3:13 contradict what happened to Elijah (2 Kings 2:11) and Enoch (Hebrews 11:5)?

Jesus’ statement in John 3:10-13 refers to the revelation of heavenly mysteries. Jesus is the only One who originates from heaven and descended from there to reveal these mysteries to us. Elijah and Enoch ascended into heaven but never returned again to tell of the heavenly mysteries that they had witnessed. Rather, they remained in heaven, in God’s presence.

Jesus came from His Father and returned to Him after His resurrection to sit at the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19). Only Jesus can tell of heavenly truths from personal experience since he comes from heaven. “No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known” (John 1:18).

Since Jesus has come down to reveal God to man, there is no need for us to try and go up to heaven to access God’s truth. Jesus brought God’s Word near to us so that we can know and live by it. “’The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,’ that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:8-9).

## Why do Christians eat pork?

The Torah consists of two parts - the moral law and the civil law. The moral law dealt with ethics. The civil law consisted of rules and regulations pertaining to everyday life such as food, clothing, and religious ritual. The purpose of the civil law was to set the Children of Israel apart from all other nations. They were to be different from all other people of the earth because they worshipped the one true God. Therefore they were not to adopt the practices of the idolatrous worship around them.

One of the civil laws was that you were not allowed to eat pork. The Torah forbids the eating of pork (Leviticus 11:7-8). Jews regard the eating of pork as an unholy act.

By the time of Jesus, these civil laws had become a mere sign of holiness. The people had become hypocrites only pretending to be holy while their hearts were evil. Jesus saw how they were abusing the civil law. So He declared all food clean for the purpose of exposing their hypocrisy and refocusing on the true holiness of the heart.

Jesus declared it permissible to eat all food (Mark 7:14-19). The Qur’an quotes Jesus as saying, “And (I come) confirming that which was before me of the Torah, and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you” (Surah Aal-‘Imran 3:50).

## Why are there so many different churches?

Muslims point to their unity to show that their religion is preferable to Christianity. Islam’s unity results from uniformity to rules and religious forms. Muslims can go to any mosque anywhere in the world and know exactly how to perform their ritual prayers.

All Churches are unified on matters of doctrine and faith. Although they may use different styles to worship God, they all believe in the Trinity, salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and that the Torah, Zabur and Injil are God’s Word.

Christians have three main groups (Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant). Muslims are divided into two main groups (Sunni and Shiite).

Many think that a church is a building, something like a mosque. The word, “Church,” is translated from the Greek word “Ecclesia,” which means “those that have been called out.” Jesus has called His followers out of the world and into a relationship with God and other believers.

## Why don’t Christians fast?

Muslims want to please God by doing good deeds. Fasting is one of these deeds. They believe that fasting makes them pure from “within” as other aspects of Shari’ia make him externally pure. “O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil)” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183).

In contrast to Muslims, Christians do not have an organized period of fasting but instead give alms and fast in private for God’s sake. Fasting is a personal matter. Jesus taught that we should not be obvious in our fasting so that other people praise us (Matthew 6:16-19). Fasting does not only need to be abstaining from food. Examples of fasting are (1) Jonah 3 – because of repenting, (2) Esther 4:15-17 – asking for God’s help (3) Acts 13:1-3 – seeking God’s guidance.

God draws near to those who fast according to His law. “Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter—when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?”(Isaiah 58:6-7).

## Why don’t Christians obey commands like circumcision and resting on the Sabbath?

Both Islam and Christianity teach that some commands that were previously given no longer need to be applied. But Christianity does not hold to the principle of abrogation as described in the Qur’an. Abrogation means that God chose to reveal a verse that supersedes an earlier revelation. “Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is able to do all things?” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:106).

The Injil, on the other hand, doesn’t blot out previous revelations but completes them. Jesus declared, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17). The laws in the Torah find their true meaning and completion in the Messiah’s work. They were merely a shadow of the reality that is Jesus and were never intended to continue in the form in which they were initially revealed.

The Torah was for a certain people (the Israelites) and for a certain time (until the coming of the Messiah). None of the prophets abrogated their own words. Instead the whole covenant changed at once. The Qur’an is different. Muhammad gave all the abrogated and the abrogating verses to the same people within a few years, sometimes even abrogating them within a few months.

## What is meant by the Kalimatullah (Word of God)?

Four times Muhammad used the term Kalimatullah declaring that Jesus is a Word of God or his word (Surah Aal-‘Imran 3:39, 45; An-Nisa' 4:171).

God’s Word cannot be separated from God Himself. Through His Word, God unleashes His creative power, His healing power, His forgiving authority, His comforting mercy. When it says that Jesus is the Kalimatullah, it means that all the attributes of the word of God are present in Jesus.

Jesus in the Injil states, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30). Jesus is closest to God as He is the Word of God. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:1, 14).

## Why do Christians pray to statues?

Of the main groups in Christianity, only Catholics and Orthodox use images and statues. Protestants do not. Statues are a teaching tool used to help one recall the person depicted. In the Early Church they were especially useful for the instruction of the illiterate.

God’s law given through Moses forbids the worship of images as gods, but He doesn’t ban the making of images. Moses himself instructed that a bronze snake should be made to heal the Israelites. It is idolatry when people consider a statue to be a god. When the Jews began to worship the bronze serpent made by Moses, King Hezekiah had it destroyed (2 Kings 18:4).

Though bowing can be used as a posture in worship, not all bowing is worship. A Catholic can kneel in front of a statue without worshipping the statue. If a Muslim kneels in prayer with the Qur’an open before him, no one considers him to be worshipping the Qur’an or praying to it.
