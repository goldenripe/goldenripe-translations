# Bible and Qur’an

## Hasn’t the Bible (Torah, Zabur and Injil) been changed?

Both Jesus and Qur’an state clearly that God’s Word can never be altered. Jesus said, “For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished” (Matthew 5:18). On another occasion Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Matthew 24:35).

In the Qur’an we read, “Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower” (Surah Al-An’am 6:115). If the Qur’an states that no one can change God’s words, why do you accuse God of not being strong enough to protect His Scripture from evildoers? Do you think that God was asleep when they changed it? Astagfirullah!

Perhaps it is best to read the Bible and try to determine for yourself whether or not it has been changed.

## Wasn’t the Bible already corrupted before Muhammad was born?

Muhammad believed that the Torah, Zabur and Injil available in his day were accurate. According to Islamic teaching, the Qur’an was given to confirm the validity of previous holy books. “He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture with truth, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, even as He revealed the Torah and the Injil. Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong)” (Surah Aal-‘Imran 3:3-4).

Muhammad was instructed to read the Torah, Zabur and Injil. “And if thou (Muhammad) art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto thee, then question those who read the Scripture (that was) before thee. Verily the Truth from thy Lord hath come unto thee. So be not thou of the waverers. And be not thou of those who deny the revelations of Allah, for then wert thou of the losers” (Surah Yunus 10:94-95). Certainly God would not have asked Muhammad to read corrupted revelation.

Muhammad also quotes many verses from the Torah, Zabur and Injil. If they had been changed, certainly a prophet would have known.

## Didn’t people change the Bible after Muhammad gave us the Qur’an?

Muslims believe that the Bible has been changed since passages in the Bible are not consistent with the teachings of the Qur’an. Since the Qur’an, written in the 7th century A.D., never states that the Bible has been changed people therefore assume that it must have been changed after Muhammad lived.

The Injil was originally written from 50–95 A.D. We have fragments from within one generation of its original writing and whole books from about 100 years after the original manuscript. Existing copies of the complete Injil are from the year 325 A.D. which predates Muhammad by several hundred years. Examination of the 24,000 ancient manuscripts in existence prove that no changes were made to the Torah, Zabur and Injil. It would be impossible for someone to gather the thousands of manuscripts from around the world and make changes to all of them.

## Didn’t the Jews change the Bible?

There is no way that Christians would have allowed the Jews to change what was written in the Injil. Any attempts, therefore, to change the Injil would have been resisted.

The Jews also knew that God told them never to change His Words. We read in the Torah, “Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you” (Deuteronomy 4:2). No one would be foolish enough to alter the Torah. God promised to destroy them just like He destroyed those who worshipped idols (Deuteronomy 4:3).

Since God’s Word is perfect, we are reminded not to change it. “Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar” (Proverbs 30:5-6).

## Didn’t the Christians change the Bible?

The Bible warns Christians not to change the Bible. “If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City” (Revelation 22:18b-19). Anyone changing the Injil would put himself under great punishment. The price paid for changing the Injil is too great. Certainly no one is would so stupid that he would destroy his eternal future.

When talking about the end times, Jesus said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Matthew 24:35). He did not say that during the end times everything will be fine. In fact there will be great tribulations. He even said that on that final day heaven and earth will pass away. But we can be certain that even though everything else passes away, the Injil will never change.

## Why should a Muslim read the Injil since the Qur’an is the final revelation?

Some Muslims think that the Qur’an has made the earlier Scriptures irrelevant. But a Muslim is required to believe in all the holy books and not just the Qur’an. “O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger, and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime. Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day, he verily hath wandered far astray” (Surah An-Nisa' 4:136). In order to believe in these holy books, you have to read them.

There is a lot of information that we can only get by reading the Torah, Zabur and Injil. For instance, the Qur’an lists 25 prophets such as Adam, Noah, Moses, etc. The Qur’an does not provide a detailed account of their lives and words. Therefore it is necessary to read the Torah, Zabur and Injil in order to know what these prophets did and taught.

Another example is the story of the plagues that God sent against Pharaoh and Egypt in order to free the Israelites. The Qur’an states that there are 9 plagues. But only 6 of them are recorded in the Qur’an. To learn of the other 3, you need to read the Torah.

## Did God or man write the Injil?

Luke personally investigated all the eyewitness accounts concerning Jesus. Luke said, “Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught” (Luke 1:1-4). These verses show how God revealed the Injil through people like Luke. God gave experiences and spoke to individuals like Luke in order to bring them to a place where they could record revelation.

God’s word is given to man in different ways. According to Islam, God’s word was printed in a book that is distributed by people. In Christianity, God’s word became a man. “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). If God’s word could be in a book, then one would also have to admit that God’s word could be in human form.

## Which of the 4 gospels did Jesus bring?

Jesus did not bring a single book in the same way that Moses (Torah), David (Zabur) or Muhammad (Qur’an) did. Instead the Injil is a collection of writings that give a picture of the life of Jesus.

The followers of Jesus wrote down the words and actions of Jesus to ensure their accuracy. Although, the Holy Spirit used various people to write down the Injil, they clearly have one single source - Jesus.

## How did they decide which of the many gospels were true?

There is only one Gospel or Injil that Jesus brought. However Christians use the term “gospel” to refer to the description of the actions and words of Jesus as recorded by His followers. Several of His followers were inspired to write record Jesus’ actions and words. A better question to ask is, “How did they decide which of these accounts were accurate?”1.9.1.2 The writings accepted by the first Christians are almost identical to those which were gathered together to form the New Testament used today. Church councils held at Hippo Regius (located in modern day Algeria) in 393 and at Carthage (located in modern day Tunisia) in 397 did not determine which of the accounts were acceptable, but simply confirmed what was already being used by the church.

From early in the church’s history, the four accounts found in the Bible were made into a single collection. The Council in Carthage merely validated the 4 accounts recording the life of Jesus from among the many that were available. These 4 accounts were recorded by those who were within the original church (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John). The others that were rejected originated from sects who wrote them to bolster their beliefs.

These accounts did not become authoritative because the Council in Carthage formally decided to include them in the Bible. They were included in the Bible because they were already regarded as God’s Word.

## Which translation of the Bible is correct?

None of the holy books were written in modern day languages. The Torah and Zabur were written in Hebrew and Aramaic, while the Injil was written in Greek. Like the Qur’an that was written in Arabic, a translation into a modern day language is needed so we can understand what we are reading.

In the 1380s, John Wycliffe completed the first English language translation of the Bible. Up until that time, most people used the 4th century Latin translation of the Bible by Jerome. For 300 years the King James Version, published in 1611, was the translation mostly used in Protestant churches. However, languages are continually changing. Many found it difficult to understand 17th century English language. Therefore updated English language translations were necessary.

Dr. Lewis Foster, one of those who helped translate the NIV and the NKJV says, “It is necessary to continue making new translations and revising old ones if people are to read the Word of God in their contemporary languages.”

There are even many different English translations of the Qur’an. Several popular translations used by Muslims are the ones done by Dr. Hilali and Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Pickthall, and Yusuf Ali.

## How do we know which holy books are the true word of God and not something which was made up?

God authenticated His holy books in a manner that could not be duplicated by mere humans. This authentication was done through prophecies which foretold events before they occurred.

For instance, Ezekiel 26 records the details of how the city of Tyre would be destroyed. The city would be torn down and its debris thrown into the sea. This happened exactly as God said it would. Alexander the Great made a land bridge using the rubble of the city of Tyre to attack a tower on an island.

There are also hundreds of prophecies that were fulfilled by Jesus. These prophecies predicted where Jesus would be born and how He would die. They even stated that He would come back to life again. All of these were fulfilled by Jesus. The resurrection of Jesus was witnessed by many people who testified to the accuracy of what was recorded in the Injil.

Only the Torah, Zabur and Injil record prophecies that were later fulfilled. The Qur’an does not record any prophecies to verify it even though Muhammad was asked to do so by his followers (Surahs Al-Isra’ 17:91-95; Al-Ankabut 29:47-51).

## How do we know that the Bible is the Word of God, and not the Apocrypha or the Book of Mormon?

Since prophecy is the test of a holy books authenticity (refer to the previous question), let’s examine these books to see if they pass this test.

Joseph Smith, who wrote the Book of Mormon, tried to do some miracles but failed several times. He prophesied that Jesus would return in the year 1891. But Jesus never did. None of Joseph Smith’s other prophecies came true.

The Apocrypha were written between 300 B.C. and 100 A.D. Yet none of these books were written by a prophet or record any fulfilled prophecy. Jesus quoted from many sections of the Torah and Zabur, yet He never once quoted from the Apocrypha. Neither did any of His disciples.

## Why are there so many discrepancies in the Injil?

Many of the oral stories about Jesus were written down over time and compiled into a book called the Injil. The different accounts of Jesus’ life are due to differing emphases by the writers and not discrepancies. The writers often summarized Jesus’ words in order to better communicate them to their different audiences. But this does not mean that they are unreliable and should be discarded. An author must choose which details are relevant to his readers.

The Qur’an also records the same events using different words. Does this mean that there are discrepancies in the Qur’an and it should be discarded? For instance, in the account of Moses and the sorcerers, Moses is quoted in different ways in Surahs Ta-Ha 20:65-73 and Ash-Shu'ara' 26:41-52.

Commenting on the verbal variations of the same stories within the Qur’an, one Muslim scholar said, “Among the mutashabih (things which resemble one another) verses are those which tell the story of Moses in many places of the Qur’an, and those, like them, which employ different words to express similar meanings. Some examples of these are: ‘Introduce therein’ and ‘Load therein’ (Surahs Al-Mu’minun 23:27; Hud 11:40); ‘Thrust thy hand’ and ‘put thy hand [into the bosom of thy robe]’ (Surahs Al-Qasas 28:32; An-Naml 27:12); and ‘So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding’ and ‘Then he flung down his staff and lo! it was a serpent manifest’ (Surahs Ta-Ha 20:20; Al-A’raf 7:107). Ibn Zayd then comments, “All this is in order to show God’s judgment between the prophets and their peoples.” Ibn Zayd goes on, “Anyone whom God wishes to test and cause to fall into error would say, ‘Why is this not like that, and why is that like this!’” (Tabari, VI, pp. 177-179). (Mahmoud M. Ayoub, The Qur’an and Its Interpreters, Vol. II - The House of Imran [State University of New York Press, Albany; 1992], p. 23).

## Why do Christians reject the Gospel of Barnabas?

Most Muslims consider the Gospel of Barnabas to be the only existing true Gospel of Jesus Christ. But analysis of the manuscript shows that the Gospel of Barnabas was written between the 14th and 16th century after Christ. There are only two existing manuscripts - one written in Spanish and the other in Italian.

The Gospel of Barnabas describes many of the events of Jesus’ life such as His miracles, teachings, betrayal, and ascension into Heaven. But it contradicts the Bible when it claims that Judas was crucified in place of Jesus.

The Gospel of Barnabas prophesies that Muhammad is to be the messenger of God. Yet the Gospel of Barnabas also contradicts what is written in the Qur’an.

- It describes Hell as only a temporary place for sinners and states that Muhammad, not Jesus, is the Messiah. But the Qur’an itself states that Jesus is the Messiah.

- In the Qur’an, Jesus is born in Jerusalem beneath a palm tree. According to the Gospel of Barnabas, Jesus is born in Bethlehem in an inn.

- In the Qur’an, Mary suffers great pains at His birth (Surah Maryam 19:23), in the Gospel of Barnabas she gives birth to Jesus without any pain.

Both Muslims and Christians should reject the Gospel of Barnabas because of these contradictions.

## Isn’t the Gospel of Barnabas a reliable holy book?

A holy book must be accurate in its details in order to be considered reliable. No one would believe that the book’s teachings are true if it is filled with historical errors. Descriptions in the Bible that were once considered inaccurate (such as names of rulers, etc.) were later proven accurate by subsequent archeological discoveries.1.15.1.2. In the Gospel of Barnabas, there are many geographical and historical errors. It says that Nazareth is a village on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. However, Nazareth is located on the top of a hill. It also states that Jesus climbs up from the Sea of Galilee to Capernaum. However, Capernaum lies directly on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. The Gospel of Barnabas reports that Jesus boarded a ship to sail to Jerusalem, yet Jerusalem lies inland and cannot be reached by ship.

The Gospel of Barnabas mentions a golden coin, the dinari worth 60 minuti (RR, LIV/128). This coin was only used for a short period in medieval Spain. It also mentions wooden barrels to store wine, whereas in the Middle East bags made of leather were commonly used.

Imagine if someone told you they found a lost “book” from God. This book stated that Muhammad sailed on a boat to Mecca. It contradicted the teaching of the Torah, Zabur, Injil and Qur’an. The oldest manuscript was written in Italian, a language that did not exist in the time of Muhammad. Would you accept this book?

## Does the Qur’an and Muhammad affirm or reject the Bible?

The Qur’an records God as saying, “And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil)” (Surah Al-Ma'idah' 5:46).

In Surah Al-Ma'idah' 5:46, Muhammad admits to 4 things:

1. Jesus was sent to confirm that the Torah was accurate. How then can one claim that the Torah has been changed?

2. God gave the Gospel (Injil) to Jesus. This means that the Gospel is revelation from God.

3. In the Gospel, there is guidance and light. Everyone who reads it will be led on the straight path to Paradise.

4. The Gospel contains special and important teaching for those who fear God.

The Qur’an confirmed that the Bible existing in Muhammad’s day had not been changed. “And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture (Qur’an) with the truth, confirming whatever Scripture (Bible) was before it, and a watcher over it” (Surah Al-Ma'idah' 5:48).

## Don’t the Qur’an and Bible teach the same thing?

We should respect all peoples and religions. Respecting something, however, does not mean that it is true. Instead we must investigate the teachings of both books to determine if they are true.

The Bible and the Qur’an differ on several things. The crucifixion and resurrection are viewed by Christians to be historical fact. The Qur’an claims that these events did not occur. The Qur’an teaches that one can enter paradise if they observe the 5 pillars of Islam. However, the Injil teaches that the only way to paradise is through faith in Jesus and not by our religious works. “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me’” (John 14:6).

They both could be wrong, but certainly they both cannot be correct since their claims contradict each other. Each of us should do further study and read both books in order to determine which one is true.

## Are there any errors in the Qur’an?

There are many historical errors in the Qur’an. The Qur’an claims that:

- Haman was pharaoh’s prime minister even though Haman lived in Babylon 1,000 years later (Surah Ghafir 40:36-37; Esther 3:1).

- A Samaritan (Samiri) made the golden calf for the children of Israel and the golden calf was lowing (Surah Ta-Ha 20:85-88). However the Samaritans did not exist at that period in history and only came after the Babylonian exile.

- The Virgin Mary gave birth to Christ under the shade of a palm tree and not in a manger as stated in the Injil (Surah Maryam 19:23; Luke 2:7).

There are also scientific problems in the Qur’an. Surah Al-Kahf 18:85-86 tells of when Alexander the Great (Zulqarnain) came to the place where the sun set. There he “found it setting in a muddy spring.” As part of a historical narrative of Alexander the Great’s life, this passage must be taken literally. To believe that the Qur’an is without error, then you must believe that the sun sets in a pond of mud.

The Qur’an gives two different accounts of creation. Surah Al-A’raf 7:54 says that God created the heaven and the earth in 6 days. But Surah Fussilat 41 states that creation took 8 days and not 6 days - 2 days to create the earth (Surah Fussilat 41:9), then 4 days for the earth’s nourishment (Surah Fussilat 41:10), and another 2 days to create the heavens (Surah Fussilat 41:12).

It only takes one error to prove that the Qur’an is not a perfect book.

## How can people like David and Solomon be prophets since they committed grave sins?

Both Muslims and Christians hold prophets in high regard since they are sent by God to speak His words to us. But Islam teaches that Allah protected prophets from sins and bad diseases.

Christians do not believe that the prophets were sinless. The Torah, Zabur and Injil always present people as they really are. This includes their weaknesses and sins. No one can fully obey the Law so they deserve death. But the prophets knew that God would one day forgive their sins through a great sacrifice just as He spared Abraham’s son by providing a substitute sacrifice.

The prophets' sin did not negate the truth of their message since that message originated with God. This shows that God’s mercy and kindness are stronger than even the prophets’ weaknesses and sins. Even the sin of the prophets cannot keep God’s plans from taking place.

Only Jesus was without sin according to the testimony of the Injil and Qur’an.
