# Death and Resurrection

## Wasn’t Jesus taken right up to heaven and someone else died on the cross in His place?

Some Muslims believe that God made someone look like Jesus who was subsequently crucified in the place of Jesus. This is known as the substitution theory. Muslims cannot agree who was made to look like Jesus. Some say that it was Judas while others say it was a different one of Jesus’ disciples.

But there are many problems if we agree that people can be changed into someone else’s likeness. If that were the case, then we can never be certain that what we saw really happened. A criminal in court could proclaim his innocence by saying that God must have made someone else look like him and that impostor committed the crime.

Also, what is the purpose of changing someone else into the likeness of Jesus? God could have taken Jesus into heaven or killed those who wanted to crucify Jesus. Wouldn’t that have been simpler? Instead someone else was made to die a pointless death.

Remember, people died a slow death on the cross. If someone who was not Jesus was crucified, all he would have to do is shout out, “I am not Jesus. I am someone else.” Certainly these words would spread throughout the crowd. But that never happened.

## Didn’t Jesus only faint on the cross and not die?

Some Muslims believe that Jesus was crucified but did not die. He swooned on the cross and became unconscious. The Roman soldiers thought He was dead so they buried Him in a tomb. Then the disciples entered the tomb some time later and resuscitated Jesus. Although this is an interesting theory, nowhere does the Qur’an state that Jesus swooned on the cross.

The Injil, on the other hand, clearly states that Jesus died on the cross. “But when they (the soldiers) came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break His legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water” (John 19:33-34). Muslims say that the Roman soldier pierced Jesus’ side with a spear in an effort to revive Him. But spearing someone in the side is how you kill them not assist their recovery.

To accept the Qur’an’s claim that Jesus did not die on the cross would mean that you also have to deny the prophecies of God’s prophets concerning Jesus’ death.

## How can you know Jesus died on the cross rather than sometime later?

Out of more than 6,000 verses in the Qur’an, there is not a single verse that says Jesus did not die on the cross or that Jesus was never crucified. Only one verse discusses the crucifixion. “And because of their (the Jews) saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah’s messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain. But Allah took him up unto Himself. Allah was ever Mighty, Wise” (Surah An-Nisa' 4:157-158). This verse does not say that Jesus never died on the cross. It only says that the Jews did not crucify Jesus.

The Qur’an mentions that Jesus will die. “Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!” (Surah Maryam 19:33).

The Qur’an tells those in doubt, “And if thou art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto thee, then question those who read the Scripture (that was) before thee” (Surah Yunus 10:94). The People of the Book know how Jesus died because the Injil gives a clear answer. “This man [Jesus] was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him” (Acts 2:23-24).

## How could God allow Jesus to suffer a shameful death on the cross?

Death on the cross was filled with shame. It was reserved for only the worse criminals (Deuteronomy 21:22-23). Being hung on the cross is a sign of God’s curse on Jesus. This led many Jews to reject Jesus as the Son of God because dying on the cross proved that He was cursed by God.

But God predestined Jesus to die in this way. “He (Jesus) said to them, ‘How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself” (Luke 24:25-27).

The Torah and Zabur record 333 prophecies that were fulfilled by Jesus. God tells us through His prophet that Jesus will be pierced (Zechariah 12:10). Why did this happen? “On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity” (Zechariah 13:1).

Jesus bore our sins and came under the curse of God. “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: ‘Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole’” (Galatians 3:13). The curse that was on us was put on Christ and we were redeemed from it by Him.

## If Jesus died on the cross, did the part of Him that was God also die?

Nowhere in the Bible does it say, “God died.” God is the source of all life. He is life itself (Psalms 36:9). Since God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:16), He cannot possibly die.

On the cross, Jesus gave His life for mankind. God was present in the crucified Jesus and then raised Jesus up. But when Jesus died on the cross, God did not die. Only Jesus’ body, which He had taken on when He became human, died.

This is similar to what happens to Christians when they die. Until Jesus’ return, their bodies decay and turn to dust in the grave. Yet their souls live on in God’s presence. When Jesus returns, their bodies will be resurrected (Romans 8:9–11; I Corinthians 15:50-54).

## Is God so weak and helpless that He can be crucified by humans?

Muslims say that Matthew 27:46 shows that Jesus was not willing to be crucified. Yet there is no way that Jesus could have been crucified unless He was willing. Muslims believe that God sent the angel Jibril to always be with Jesus. Certainly no harm could come to Jesus because the tip of Jibril’s wing is enough to guard all of mankind. So the only logical conclusion is that Jesus allowed Himself to be crucified. Why would He do this?

God is Holy but also just (Hebrews 6:10). Because of this, He must punish sin. Islam teaches that our good works will cancel out our sins and if the scale tilts in our favor, we will enter Paradise. Yet Adam only committed one sin, and because of that God expelled Adam from Paradise. If you have committed even one sin like Adam, what hope do you have of entering Paradise?

Since it is impossible for our good works will never be enough to outweigh a single sin, then we need a different way to enter Paradise. Jesus was willing to die on the cross so we could be set free from the penalty of our sins. Only through believing in Jesus can we enter Paradise.

## Why is Judas guilty if it was God’s will for Jesus to die?

The Bible records prophecies such as Psalm 41:9 and Zechariah 11:10-13 that foretold Jesus’ betrayal. Do these prophecies mean that Judas was forced into action in order to fulfill these prophecies?

God is both King and Judge. As King, He is the sovereign and controls all things according to His will. As Judge, He holds everyone responsible for their choices.

We know that God is able to do anything He desires. “I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted” (Job 42:2). God may act directly or indirectly through the laws of nature, etc. He may even fulfill His plan by taking His hands off in a given situation. God created humans are free creatures responsible to God for the decisions that they make. God allows them to act even though He knows what they will do before they do it. Judas made the free choice to betray Jesus therefore he is responsible for his actions.

Jesus knew that Judas would betray Him (John 6:64, Matthew 26:25) and allowed it to happen (John 13:27-28). The Injil points out that Judas betrayed Jesus as a voluntary act (Luke 22:1-6; Matthew 26:14-16). After the betrayal, Judas confessed his own sin. “’I have sinned,’ he said, ‘for I have betrayed innocent blood’” (Matthew 27:4).

## Where was Jesus for the 3 days that He was dead?

When Jesus died on the cross, He did not swoon or faint. He really died. On the third day He rose from the dead. Between His death and resurrection, Jesus’ human body was in the tomb, but He was alive. Jesus, the author of life, was could not die. The Bible records some details about what Jesus was doing during this period of time.

The Bible says that Jesus visited the realm of the dead where He delivered a message to spirit beings (1 Peter 3:18-20). Peter did not tell us what Jesus proclaimed to these spirits. It was probably a declaration of victory over Satan and his hosts (1 Peter 3:22).

While hanging on the cross, Jesus promised to take the thief next to Him into Paradise. Ephesians 4:8-10 states that Jesus went to those who had believed in Him prior to His death and took them into Paradise. During these 3 days, Jesus was not giving people a second chance for salvation. The Injil tells us that we face judgment after death (Hebrews 9:27).

## Why didn’t Jesus save Himself from being crucified?

At the crucifixion, the enemies of Jesus mocked Him as He hung on the cross. They called out to Jesus telling Him to prove that He was the Messiah by coming down from the cross. “‘He saved others,’ they said, ‘but he can’t save himself!’” (Mark 15:31).

Don’t be mistaken. Jesus could have prevented Himself from being crucified. Jesus could have come down from the cross at any time but He chose not to. He went to the cross willingly to die in our place. His death was necessary to satisfy the law which demanded that the penalty for sin be paid for by death. If Jesus had not died, we would have had to die for our own sins.

The only way we could be spared this death was if Jesus did not save Himself. “He told them, ‘This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem’” (Luke 24:46-47).

## Did Jesus really rise from the dead?

If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then Christianity is a lie and no one should believe it. Jesus claimed that He would prove that He is the Lord by rising from the dead. On five separate occasions, Jesus predicted that He would die and then three days later come back to life.

Jesus’ lifeless body was placed in a solid rock tomb. A two-ton boulder was rolled over the entrance of the tomb. Because Jesus had publicly said He would rise from the dead, a group of trained Roman soldiers was stationed at the tomb to stand guard. Yet three days later, the tomb was empty. Only the grave clothes remained. The boulder used to shut up the tomb was found up a slope, some distance away from the tomb.

If Jesus’ enemies wanted to put an end to Christianity, all they needed to do was show Jesus’ corpse to the people in Jerusalem. That would prove once and for all that Jesus did not come back to life. But they could not produce Jesus’ body.

Thomas, one of Jesus’ disciples, heard the news that Jesus had risen. But Thomas would not believe it. He said that he would not believe it unless he saw the wounds on Jesus for himself. When Jesus later appeared to His disciples, Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus told him “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (John 20:24-29).
