# Muhammad and Islam

## Is Muhammad a prophet?

A prophet is one who tells what will happen in the future. So to determine whether or not Muhammad was a prophet, we need to ask what future prophecy did Muhammad give that was subsequently fulfilled? There was none.

Even Muhammad said this of himself. “Say: I am no new thing among the messengers (of Allah), nor know I what will be done with me or with you. I do but follow that which is inspired in me, and I am but a plain warner” (Surah Al-Ahqaf 46:9).

Muhammad says that he does not know about the future like prophets did. He was only able to warn and guide.

## Do Christians recognize Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah?

Christians and Muslims alike value Muhammad as an exceptional historic personality. Politically, Muhammad is recognized by Christians to be a reformer and a leader. Additionally we know that Muhammad called people to turn away from idolatry.

Muhammad, however, did not recognize the great love that God had for the world. God revealed that love through the life, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus.

Christians are not able to agree with what Muslims confess about Muhammad. The Muslim creed states that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Christians do not accept the Qur’an’s teaching that he is the last prophet.

## Why don’t Christians believe the Bible’s prophesies about the coming of Muhammad?

Muslims believe that Moses prophesied about the coming of Muhammad in Deuteronomy 18:18. “I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him.” This verse says that the coming prophet will be “from among their fellow Israelites.” Jesus was a Jew whereas Muhammad was not. This verse fits Jesus better than Muhammad.

Muslims also apply Deuteronomy 34:10-11 to Muhammad. “Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, who did all those signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.” But this verse could not possibly apply to Muhammad since he never said he got his words directly from Allah. Muhammad claimed to receive revelation through angels (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:97). It is Jesus who communicated directly with God (John 1:18).

Also Deuteronomy 34:10-11 talks about performing signs and wonders. Muhammad never performed signs and wonders (miracles), except for reciting the Qur’an (Surah Al-Isra’ 17:90-93). This is also recorded in the Hadiths (Sahih Bukhari 9:92:379). The Injil, on the other hand, records many miracles that Jesus performed.

## Isn’t Muhammad the promised Paracletos?

The Injil has a lot to say about the promised Paracletos. It would be good to read John 14:16-26; 15:26; 16:5-15. These verses have many descriptions that will help you decide if Muhammad is the promised Paracletos. For instance, in John 14:17 it says that the Paracletos cannot be seen and that He will live in you. Yet Muhammad could be seen and does not live in you. Therefore the Paracletos could not possibly be Muhammad.

Jesus says that the Paracletos would be sent by God, “in my name” (John 14:26) and also that “I will send him to you” (John 16:7). This means that if Muhammad was the promised Paracletos, then Muslims would have to accept that God sent Muhammad in Jesus’ name (John 14:26) and that Muhammad was also sent by Jesus too (John 16:7). No knowledgeable Muslim would ever accept that. So these verses must refer to another who was sent from God.

## Is Muhammad the last prophet?

Muslims say that Muhammad came to complete and perfect previous religions. “Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of God and the last (end) of the Prophets. And God is Ever All-Aware of everything” (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:40).

According to Islam, Allah has sent 124,000 prophets. Muhammad is one of these. Yet only one of these prophets was called the Messiah. It is more important to know why only one was called the Messiah than it is to know which is the last in a list of 124,000 prophets.

Messiah means “The Anointed One” or “The Chosen One.” The Messiah was chosen or anointed, “to redeem those under the law” (Galatians 4:5). The prophet Isaiah foretold that the Messiah will bring salvation to the ends of the earth (Isaiah 49:6, Zechariah 9:9-10). It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the name Jesus means “God’s salvation” (or “the Lord saves”).

## Why don’t Christians accept that Islam is the final religion?

Muslims say that Islam is the perfect religion; “Innaddinn aindallah hilislam,” and the Qur’an is the complete and perfect book. In order to say that Islam completes the teaching of the Injil, there must be continuity between the two. Yet much of the teachings of the Injil and Qur’an do not coincide with each other. For instance, the Injil teaches that humans were born with a sinful and corrupted nature, but Muslims deny this. They also disagree about the death and resurrection of Jesus.

Muhammad came to correct and improve upon the writings of the other prophets.

Jesus came not to correct and improve but to complete that which was given through the prophets before Him. Jesus says, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End” (Revelation 22:13). Jesus is the sum total of all that God wants to speak to man. All previous messages through the prophets were partial and preparatory, awaiting the full revelation of Jesus, the Kalimatullah (John 1:1, 14, 18).

## Why don’t Christians convert to Islam?

God created Adam and Eve without sin, but they disobeyed God and were cast out of Paradise. Before God expelled them from Paradise He promised that one of their descendants will destroy Satan and remove man’s sin.

When God called Abraham, He promised that the descendants of Abraham’s son will bless the world by destroying the works of Satan. Later God tested Abraham by instructing to sacrifice that son. In response to Abraham’s obedience, God provided a lamb to be sacrificed in the son’s place.

Later God caused the Virgin Mary to become pregnant by the Holy Spirit. When the child was born, He was given the name Jesus which means “God saves” because Jesus will save man from their sin.

Someone asked the Prophet John, “Are you the one that was prophesied about that will come and destroy Satan and remove man’s sin?” John said it was not him but that he came to prepare the way for the promise of God. When he saw Jesus, the Prophet John proclaimed, “Look, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!” Jesus died as a sacrifice to pay the penalty for our sin. By doing so He destroyed the power of Satan and freed us from our sin.

This is why Christians believe in Jesus. He is the Spirit of God (Rohullulah) and the Word of God (Kalimatullah) that was promised to Adam and Abraham.
