# Paradise and Redemption

## How is it fair that we are condemned by Adam’s sin?

Muslims reject the idea of original sin because they understand it to mean that everyone inherited the guilt of Adam and Eve’s sin. It seems unfair to them that others should have to accept guilt for Adam and Eve’s disobedience.

The Injil teaches, “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death [the result of sin] came to all people, because all sinned.” Adam's sin led to the condemnation of all mankind. (Romans 5:12-18; I Corinthians 15:21-22).

Christians do not believe in inherited sin, but original sin. We did not inherit any sin from Adam and Eve, but only the desire to sin. Because of that desire, we have all sinned. Thus, we are condemned because we ourselves have sinned against God.

But God gave us a way to be set free from this judgment and condemnation. “Consequently, just as one [Adam’s] trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people” (Romans 5:18). Jesus acquitted us from God’s judgment.

## How can Jesus pay the penalty for someone else’s sin?

Ransom or redemption means paying the price to secure someone’s freedom. For instance, we read, “Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim” (Surah As-Saffaat 37:107). Abraham’s son was ransomed by a substitute.

The Qur’an also states that only those who have a strong covenant with God can redeem others (Surahs Maryam 19:87; Ta-Ha 20:109). The Qur’an teaches that no sinner can ever be a substitute for another sinner because they do not have a strong covenant with God. “No laden soul will bear another’s load” (Surah Az-Zumar 39:7). But the converse of this is also true. Someone who has never sinned can bear another’s sin. Muhammad could not bear the sins of others because he had sinned himself.

Jesus has a strong covenant with God so He has the right to redeem others. According to the Qur’an, Jesus never sinned (Surah Maryam 19:19). Four times Muhammad wrote that he had sinned (Surahs Ghafir 40:55; Muhammad 47:19; Al-Fath 48:12; An-Nasr 110:3). Jesus never needed to ask God for forgiveness because He never sinned. Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God, bore the sins of the world (John 1:29).

## If Jesus died to save us, then doesn’t that mean we don’t take responsibility for our own sins?

God is just. Because we have sinned, God must punish us by condemning us to death. But God is love (I John 4:8). He wants to spare us from His wrath. This creates a dilemma since His love cannot contradict His justice.

God provided a law that would maintain justice (sin punished with death), while offering love and mercy. God accepted the blood of an innocent animal as a payment for guilty sinners. “For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement (a covering for sin) for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life” (Leviticus 17:11).

These sacrifices were a symbol of a future sacrifice. The prophets foretold that God would one day send a perfect sacrifice, i.e. the Messiah, who would give His life as the final sacrifice for sin. Jesus, the only sinless one who has ever lived, became the sacrifice in our place. He bore the punishment for our sin so we might be set free.

God accepted Jesus’ sufferings and death as a sufficient payment for our sin. The proof that Jesus’ sacrifice was accepted is that Jesus rose from the dead. This is what Christians call grace. We received what we did not deserve. God spared us His wrath. It is a gift we can receive only by believing in Christ.

## Why doesn’t God, the merciful Lord, simply forgive sin?

Because of our sin, we are destined to suffer in Hell forever. God’s holiness does not tolerate sin. “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). This is God’s law and justice. Yet, God is love (I John 4:8). Thus He planned a way of salvation for mankind. His plan is the only straight path which delivers man from the punishment of death. God’s holiness demanded justice while His love pleaded for mercy and forgiveness.

God’s justice means He cannot just forget about our sin. Imagine if a judge said that a thief who stole $1,000,000 from you did not have to pay it back because he felt sorry and wanted to forgive the thief. That would not be fair to you.

A righteous God cannot judge unjustly. In order to meet the requirements of His justice and love, Jesus was punished instead of us. The Injil explains, “that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation” (2 Corinthians 5:19).

“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).

## Can keeping the Five Pillars of Islam get one into Paradise?

Many people think, “If my good deeds outweigh my bad deeds, then God will welcome me into Paradise.” To accumulate good deeds, Muslims perform the Five Pillars of Islam. But wouldn’t we consider it unjust if a judge freed a murderer simply because the murderer has a history of doing many good deeds.

God’s justice demands that every sin be punished. If a murderer’s good deeds cannot set him free, certainly God will not free us from the penalty of our sins because of our good deeds. Only a single sin condemns us to death. If a single drop of poison is put in a glass of water, isn’t the entire glass of water contaminated? Adding more water to it will not remove the poison. Neither can good works erase the sins that we have committed.

Because God loves us so much, He provided a way for us to enter Paradise. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). We must admit to God that we are a sinner separated from Him, and that the Son of God, Jesus, died to pay our penalty. We must believe in Jesus as our Savior who can forgive us.

## How can someone be certain they will go to Paradise?

The Qur’an says that all Muslims (apart from those who die in the Jihad) must go to Hell. “Here is not one of you but shall approach it (Hell). That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord. Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers crouching there” (Surah Maryam 19:71-72). Muslims have no confidence that God will forgive their sins on the last day. As a result, many face Judgment Day with great fear. No matter how diligent and fervent they perform their prayers or fast, there is no certainty that they will be accepted by God.

The Injil teaches a wholly different message. It gives all who believe proof that God will forgive their sins and bring them into Paradise. Jesus’ resurrection from the dead was a sign that Jesus’ sacrifice for our sins was accepted and death was defeated. Only by accepting the offer of a pardon through Jesus who paid for our sins can a person be saved from the judgment to come. “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life” (John 5:24).
