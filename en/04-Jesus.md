# Jesus

## Why do Christians refer to Jesus as the Son of Man?

The phrase “Son of Man” is used around 200 times in the Torah, Zabur and Injil. In many instances it simply refers to an ordinary man. But in Daniel 7:13-14 we read, “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.”

The Prophet Daniel saw the Ancient of Days, a title referring to God. But the Prophet Daniel also saw one who was like a son of man who is given sovereign power, worshipped by all nations, and is the king of an eternal kingdom. The “one like a son of man” in the Prophet Daniel’s vision could not be merely man for He is an eternal king.

Jesus uses this term to describe Himself. Jesus never calls Himself “a son of man.” He calls Himself THE Son of Man. He chose to use a term which identified Himself with the lowly status of mankind while showing that He is the Son of Man as described by the Prophet Daniel.

## Why do Christians refer to Jesus as the Son of God?

Often the term “Son of God” is misunderstand to mean that God literally had sexual relations with Mary and produced an offspring named Jesus. The term “Son of God” refers not to procreation, but to the special relationship that Jesus has with the Father (Luke 1:26-38).

The basic requirement of the son is to honor and obey his father. But he should also love him and emulate him. And this is what Jesus did as the Son of God. “Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father” (John 10:37-38). “Son of God” is a title for the heavenly, eternal Son who is equal to the Father (John 5:18-24).

Jesus fully reveals the Father (Matthew 11:27) and is the exact representation of the Father (Hebrews 1:1-3). Angels, humans and nature can reveal things about God. But only God alone can reveal God! “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him” (Matthew 11:27).

## Since God does not have a physical body, how can Jesus be the Son of God?

Not a single Christian believes that Jesus is the Son of God in a physical sense. They do not believe that the Father had sexual relations with Mary which produced an offspring named Jesus.

The use of expressions such as “son of” or “father of” or “mother of” is common around the world. The Qur’an itself uses the expression “Mother of the Book” (Surah Ar-Ra’d 13:39). Does that mean that there is a “Father of the Book” and “Sons of the Book” somewhere? Shi’ite Muslims have a similar concept. When they say, “Ali is the finger of God,” they do not believe that God has ten fingers like people do.

Rather this term is an expression of how Jesus is different from every created being. This was stated by the Father. “As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased’” (Matthew 3:16-17). The Father declares from heaven to all mankind that Jesus is His Son. How is it then that we will not accept this?

## Why do Christians say that Jesus is “more than all the Prophets”?

Muslims believe Jesus is one of a long line of prophets but is not greater than Muhammad. Muhammad did not claim to be more than all the prophets before him, and did not know where he or his followers would go after death. Muhammad said, “I am nothing new among prophets; I do not know what will become of me or my followers. I am just a voice of warning” (Surah Al-Ahqaf 46:9-10).

But in contrast to Muhammad, Jesus promised to take all those who believe in Him to the Father in Paradise. He said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6). Also in Luke 23:43, there was a thief that was crucified next to Jesus. After that thief believed that Jesus was the Savior, Jesus said to him, “Today you will be with me in paradise.”4.4.1.3. If you want to go to Paradise when you die, which of these two can help you get there? Muhammad or Jesus? Who do you think is greater?

Jesus is more than any other prophet. Even Muhammad confessed about Jesus in the Hadith, “Isa faa innahu rohullah wa kalimatuhu” (Jesus is the Spirit of God and the Word of God).

## If Jesus is God, why didn’t the people die when they looked at Him?

In the Torah God said to Moses, “no one may see me and live” (Exodus 33:18-23). God was telling Moses that because all have sinned and are unclean, it is impossible for anyone to appear before the Most Holy God.

In the Injil, we read that God’s majesty is revealed in Jesus (John 1:14; 11:40). During His time on earth, Jesus’ glory was hidden by His human nature. “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness” (Philippians 2:6-7). Jesus hid His majesty from us because we could not stand to view His holiness with our physical eyes.

No one has seen the Father but Jesus the Son (John 1:18, 6:46; 1 John 4:12). Human beings will only come face to face with God in heaven (1 John 3:2; 1 Corinthians 13:12; cf. 2 Corinthians 4:4-6).

## Doesn’t John 5:30 prove that Jesus did not have any power?

Jesus will perform the greatest task of all when He judges the world. Aware of this authority handed Him, Jesus humbled Himself saying, “By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me” (John 5:30). He consistently gave all the honor to the Father.

Jesus desired to do the Father’s will in both word and deed. This resulted in Jesus willingly dying on the cross to set us free from the penalty of our sins. The night before His crucifixion, Jesus prayed, “Not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42). He humbly submitted to the Father’s will even though it led Him to the agony of the cross.

If Jesus was willing to obey God to this extent, we also know that He will dispense God’s judgments according to the Father’s will. God’s Spirit examines our hearts, revealing all the sins that we have concealed. Jesus, who is in constant communion with the Father and the Spirit, knows your heart and will judge you rightly. By confessing your sins before God and accepting the forgiveness that Jesus offers you, Jesus will set you free from God’s wrath.

## Isn’t Jesus only a messenger from God and not the Lord?

Muhammad often looked to Moses as a pattern of what a messenger was to be like. Moses was a mediator between God and His people and governed them as their judge. Therefore Muhammad understood himself and Jesus as having the same authority as Moses held.

But that is not what Jesus understood about Himself. Jesus clearly saw Himself as being more than a messenger. Consider the statements Jesus made about Himself:

- “And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began” (John 17:5)

- “Then Jesus came to them and said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me’” (Matthew 28:18)

- “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die” (John 11:25)

- “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6)

Jesus’ followers and even the Jews understood that Jesus was revealing that He was Lord and not only a messenger.

- John: “Making Himself [Jesus] equal with God” (John 5:18)

- The Jews: “You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33)

- Thomas: “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28)

## Where did Jesus ever ask us to worship Him?

Nowhere does Jesus say, “I am God. Worship me,” because that statement would have caused an immediate, hostile reaction. If someone said to you, “I am God,” wouldn’t you accuse them of being either a blasphemer or a lunatic?

Jesus knew that no one would believe Him if He declared directly that He is God. Therefore He chose to reveal this in indirect ways. Jesus claimed things about Himself that only God could claim. Jesus did things that only God could do. For instance, Jesus says, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die” (John 11:25). Jesus makes eternal life conditional on faith in Him. On another occasion, Jesus’ disciples asked Him to show them the Father (God). “Jesus answered, ‘Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father… Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence [miracles] of the works themselves’” (John 14:9-11).

Jesus expected people to recognize His true identity from His words and deeds. For Jesus to come out and say, “I am God,” adds nothing of substance to the question regarding His true identity. His identity is established by the proof He gives, not by claims anyone can make.

## How could Jesus be both God and man?

Revelation is the disclosure of previously unknown truth. We can only understand anything as it relates to our immediate experience. So God used the form of a man to reveal Himself to us. ‘‘The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth’’ (John 1:14).

Now it is impossible for a man to take on a divine nature. But it is possible for God to take on a human nature. This process is described in Philippians 2:5-1 1.

The real question we should be asking is why would God do this? In the Injil we read, ‘‘But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship” (Galatians 4:4-5). Jesus is man’s Redeemer. Our desperate situation necessitated the coming of the Redeemer. There was no hope of deliverance apart from Jesus. God’s righteousness demands that every sin must be dealt with impartially.

In order to deal justly and, at the same time, mercifully, someone had to suffer the death penalty for the sin of the world. In Jesus, God solved this problem. The Father sent His Son to die as our perfect Substitute, and thereby redeemed us.

## Wasn’t Jesus a Muslim?

Islam regards itself as the original religion from which Judaism and Christianity developed. In the Qur’an we read that, “Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who had surrendered (to Allah), and he was not of the idolaters” (Aal-‘Imran 3:67). Muslims believe that many prophets of the past received the one religion of Islam (Ash-Shura 42:13). These prophets are Ibrahim (Abraham), ‘Ishaq (Issac), Yaqub (Jacob), Nuh (Noah), Dawud (David), Sulaiman (Solomon), Ayyub (Job), Yusuf (Joseph), Musa (Moses), Harun (Aaron), Zakariyya (Zachariah), Yahya (John the Baptist), Isa (Jesus), Ilyas (Elijah), Al-Yash’a (Elisha), Yunus (Jonah) and Lut (Lot) according to Surah Al-An’am 6:83-87.

The Qur’an calls Jesus the Messiah. Jesus spoke as an infant in His cradle (Surahs Aal-‘Imran 3:46; Al-Ma'idah' 5:110; Maryam 19:30). He performed miracles such as breathing life into clay birds, healing the blind and lepers, and raising the dead (Surahs Aal-‘Imran 3:49; Al-Ma'idah' 5:111). Jesus, as described in the Qur’an, is not divine. Instead it presents Jesus as a servant of God who was not crucified. This contradicts the clear teaching of the Injil which records Jesus’ death on the cross and His resurrection from the dead.

When Muslims say Jesus was a Muslim, they simply cannot be referring to the Jesus of the Injil and of history.

## When did Jesus’ status change to become Lord?

In Acts we read that “God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it… Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah” (Acts 2:32, 36). What does it mean that Jesus was made Lord and Messiah?

Previously Jesus was in heaven with only a divine nature. When the Son entered time and space, He clothed His divine nature with a human nature. Acts 2 refers to Jesus’ return to heaven where He is given a high honor. Jesus is returning with both a divine and human nature.

The Injil makes it clear that Jesus was Lord and Messiah from the beginning. The angels proclaimed, “Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord” (Luke 2:11). John also writes, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made… The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth… No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known” (John 1:1-18).

The question should not be about how Jesus became Lord but how the Word (Kalimatullah) became flesh in Jesus. The question needs to be turned round. The proper question should be how God took on human form.

## How can Jesus have the power to forgive sins? Only God can forgive sins.

In the Injil, we read that a paralyzed man was brought to Jesus. Because a crowd stood between the man and Jesus, the man’s friends lowered him through the roof to the place where Jesus sat. “When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, ‘Son, your sins are forgiven’” (Mark 2:5). The religious leaders present heard this and concluded that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy. “Who can forgive sins but God alone?” (Mark 2:7).

The religious leaders were right that only God can forgive sins. But they were wrong in failing to see that Jesus has the authority to forgive sins. The healing of the paralyzed man demonstrated this authority (Mark 2:11-12). Sickness, disease, and death are the result of the presence of sin in the world. Jesus came to solve this problem by becoming the curse for us and taking our sins on Himself. This was prophesied in Isaiah 53.

Jesus can take care of the effects of sin. He healed the paralyzed man, cleansed a leper, and raised the dead. Since He can do this, then we know that He can also remove the ultimate cause of all sickness by forgiving sin. As God, Jesus has the legal right to issue pardon for our sins. Our sins are forgiven not by following the law but by our faith in Jesus.

## If Jesus is not a created being, how can He be begotten of God?

There is confusion over how the Greek term μονογενης (or monogenes transliterated) used in the Injil should be translated. Some translations translate it as “begotten” but a better translation would be “one and only.”

Monogenes means “come from” without necessarily being created. It is similar to how Muslims believe the Qur’an was from Allah yet uncreated. Jesus, the eternal Kalimatullah (Word of God), came from God the Father. Both Muslims and Christians say the Word of God came from God but was uncreated.

Monogenes is also used in the Torah in reference to Isaac, one of Abraham’s sons. There were other sons born to Abraham. What is meant when the Torah calls Isaac the “only begotten” son of Abraham? Since God’s covenant purposes were to be carried out through Isaac, he was called “only begotten” in the sense of his uniqueness.

Jesus is unique in that only by believing in Him can one enter Paradise. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6).
