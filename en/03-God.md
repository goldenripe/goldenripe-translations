## Do Christians worship three Gods?

Muslims believe that Christians are polytheists and accuse them of worshipping three gods: the Father, Jesus, and Mary. This accusation shows their misunderstanding of what Christians believe. There is not a single Christian that believes in three gods or that Mary is one of them. The word “Trinity” refers to the belief that God exists as a unity of three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each have attributes which only God can have. In each of the following, the first verse refers to the Father, the second on to the Son and the final one to the Holy Spirit. Each are called God (Philippians 1:2; John 1:1,14; Acts 5:3-4). The Holy Books also state clearly that they are all the Creator (Isaiah 44:24; Colossians 1:15-17; Job 33:4). They are all described as being everywhere at once (1 Kings 8:27; Matthew 28:20; Psalm 139:7-10) as well as being all-knowing (1 John 3:20; John 16:30; 1 Corinthians 2:10-11).

In the Injil (Mark 12:28-31), Jesus affirmed what was written in the Torah, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). At the same time, Jesus forgave sin (Mark 2:5-12) which only God can do. He claimed to be the final judge who will determine each man’s final destiny (Matthew 7:22, 23). Jesus demonstrates that the Son and the Father are one.

## How can Jesus leave the Trinity in heaven to enter Mary’s womb and assume the human form?

Muslims claim that if God were a Trinity then it would be impossible for only one of the Trinity to come down to earth separately from the others.

The Injil says that not the entire Godhead but only the Second Person of the Trinity is incarnated. We see evidence of this in the communication between Father and Son (John 12:27-28) and when at the baptism of Jesus, the Spirit descends from heaven to rest on Him, and the voice of the Father in heaven speaks with respect to His son (Matthew 3:16-17). These verses indicate that the other two divine Persons remain in heaven.

Islam accuses Christians of promoting a mere human being, Jesus, whom they view simply as a prophet to the status of deity. But man did not become God. God took human nature alongside His divine nature without ceasing to be God. Deity and humanity are not confused in the One Person of Christ. Deity is not diluted, nor humanity elevated.

2,000 years ago, Jesus did not exist. How can something be added to God?

Jesus is only the name given to the incarnate Second Person of the Trinity. However He existed before time began in the Trinity. John 1:1 speaks not only of the Kalimatullah (Jesus) as being pre-existent, but identifies Him as the Agent of Creation.

And John 1:14 indicates that the Son became a true human being, and entered the world. “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” The Second Person of the Trinity, while still God, puts aside His heavenly glory to enter the world as a man and subject himself to the limitations and obligations of the world (Galatians 4:4).

Other verses which indicate His pre-existence are John 8:58 and Philippians 2:6-11.

## When Jesus was on earth, was heaven empty?

This statement shows that one still considers God to be like man. They figure that if someone is in Mecca, then they cannot be in Pakistan. It is impossible for a human to be in two places at once.

But God is beyond time and space. He is not constrained by these things. When Jesus came to earth, it was an act of God taking on human form and entering time and space. It is impossible for a man to become God. But it is not impossible for God to take on a human nature. When Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, He entered time and space. This was truly a miracle.

The incarnation when Jesus entered human history does not mean that heaven was empty since heaven is beyond time and space.

## Show me where in the Injil do you find the word Trinity?

You are correct when you say that the word “Trinity” is not found in the Injil. But this does not mean that the concept is not taught there. The doctrine of the Trinity was developed by theologians like Athanasius (c. 296-373 A.D.) and Augustine (354-430 A.D.), but it was not invented by them. It came out of their reading of the Injil.

The Injil did not develop the doctrine of the Trinity. Instead, it was assumed that everyone would recognize that the Injil clearly taught the full deity of Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

An example of this is the baptism of Jesus. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were all present. When Jesus came up out of the water, “he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased’” (Matthew 3:16-17). The Father’s voice sounded from above and affirmed the Sonship of Jesus, while the Holy Spirit descended on Him.

The Trinity is a mystery. There is no way that someone can fully know God. We fall into error if we reduce truth to make God comprehensible and understandable to our minds.

## How can Mary be the “mother of God”?

Mary is not the focus of the Injil, but Jesus Christ. Mary gave birth to Jesus the Messiah and therefore is His mother. Mary devoted her life to the high calling which God gave to her. According to Matthew 1:20, “what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.” Mary conceived her child as a virgin without having relations with a man. The Qur’an also records this event in Surah Aal-‘Imran 3:47 and Surah Maryam 19:19-22.

All this could happen only because Mary believed and agreed to it. And so she became the mother of God. “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:14). The meaning of the name Immanuel is ‘God with us.’

Mary must not be worshipped. Worship is due to God alone. Her title, “mother of God,” simply refers to the unique role she had in the incarnation and is given to her as a sign of respect.

## Do Christians and Muslims worship the same God?

There is a fundamental difference between the character of God in the Bible and in the Qur’an. The whole Bible is the story of God seeking man. After Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate the fruit in the garden, they tried to hide from God. The Torah describes how God came and called out to them, “Where are you?” (Genesis 3:9). Man is still is trying to run away from God because he knows that he is guilty before God.

God comes seeking after us so we can have a restored relationship with Him. God’s highest desire is for us to be with Him for eternity in heaven. The Injil describes how our life will be in heaven. “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God” (Revelation 21:3).

In contrast, the Qur’an describes God as one who is far. Islam teaches that God only makes known his will. He never reveals Himself to us. Even though he is near as the jugular vein as stated in Surah Qaf 50:16, this is only a “technical” nearness. Most of the time we are not aware of our jugular vein nor have an intimate relationship with it. This “technical” nearness only conveys that God is everywhere (far and near) like the air that is around us.

Islam is about man trying to please God by obeying his will. The Bible reveals God as taking the initiative and coming down to seek after us.
